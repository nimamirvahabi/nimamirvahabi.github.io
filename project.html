          <p>Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program
             to accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a specific task. Programming involves
              tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource 
              consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly 
              referred to as coding). The source code of a program is written in one or more languages
               that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by 
               the central processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions 
               that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system)
                on a computer, often for solving a given problem. Proficient programming thus often requires 
                expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized
                 algorithms, and formal logic.</p>
              <p>Tasks accompanying and related to programming include: testing, debugging, source code maintenance, implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such as the machine code of computer
                 programs. These might be considered part of the programming process, but often the term software development is used for this larger process with the term programming, implementation, or coding reserved for the actual writing of code. Software
                 engineering combines engineering techniques with software development practices. Reverse engineering is a related process used by designers, analysts and programmers to understand and re-create/re-implement.</p>   
                 <h1 class="text-center">History</h3>
                  <p>Programmable devices have existed for centuries. As early as the 9th century, a programmable music sequencer was invented by the Persian Banu Musa brothers, who described an 
                    automated mechanical flute player in the Book of Ingenious Devices. In 1206, the Arab engineer Al-Jazari invented a programmable drum machine where a musical mechanical automaton could be made to play different rhythms and drum patterns, via pegs and cams. In 1801, the Jacquard loom could produce entirely different weaves by changing the "program" â€“ a series of pasteboard cards with holes punched in them.
      
                    Code-breaking algorithms have also existed for centuries. In the 9th century, the Arab mathematician Al-Kindi described a cryptographic algorithm for deciphering encrypted code, in A Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages. He gave the first description of cryptanalysis by frequency analysis, the earliest code-breaking algorithm.
                    
                    The first computer program is generally dated to 1843, when mathematician Ada Lovelace published an algorithm to calculate a sequence of Bernoulli numbers, intended to be carried out by Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine.
                    
                    
                    Data and instructions were once stored on external punched cards, which were kept in order and arranged in program decks.
                    In the 1880s Herman Hollerith invented the concept of storing data in machine-readable form. Later a control panel (plugboard) added to his 1906 Type I Tabulator allowed it to be programmed for different jobs, and by the late 1940s, unit record equipment such as the IBM 602 and IBM 604, were programmed by control panels in a similar way, as were the first electronic computers. However, with the concept of the stored-program computer introduced in 1949, both programs and data were stored and manipulated in the same way in computer memory.</p>
